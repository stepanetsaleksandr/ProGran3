## 🎯 GUIDELINES

### Adding New Documents:

**Security related** → `docs/security/`  
**Implementation plans** → `docs/development/`  
**Plugin integration** → `docs/integration/`  
**Daily reports** → `docs/daily/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md`  
**Old/reference** → `docs/archive/`

### Root Level:
Only add if it's a **main entry point** (README, ROADMAP, STATUS, etc.)
