## 🚨 NEXT 2 HOURS - EMERGENCY ACTIONS

### Critical Fix #1: Remove Hardcoded Credentials (30 min)

**File:** `server/app/api/licenses/activate/route.ts`

**Problem:**
```typescript
// EXPOSED DATABASE KEY IN CODE! 
const supabase = createClient(
  'https://zgkxtdjdaqnktjxunbeu.supabase.co',
  'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...'  // FULL ACCESS
);
```

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Use centralized function instead
import { createSupabaseClient } from '@/lib/supabase';

const supabase = createSupabaseClient(); // No hardcoded values
```

**Actions:**
```bash
# 1. Edit the file
code server/app/api/licenses/activate/route.ts

# 2. Replace lines 4-7 with import + function call

# 3. Commit and push
git add server/app/api/licenses/activate/route.ts
git commit -m "SECURITY: Remove hardcoded credentials"
git push
```

**Impact:** Prevents database breach

---

### Critical Fix #2: Delete Debug Endpoints (1 hour)

**Problem:** 24 dangerous endpoints accessible in production

**Fix:**
```bash
cd server/app/api

# Delete all debug/test endpoints
rm -rf debug-*
rm -rf test-*
rm -rf cleanup-*
rm -rf clear-all-data
rm -rf nuclear-cleanup
rm -rf check-*
rm -rf raw-*
rm -rf setup-*
rm -rf fix-*
rm -rf force-*
rm -rf final-*

# Commit
git add -A
git commit -m "SECURITY: Remove debug endpoints from production"
git push
```

**Impact:** Prevents data deletion attacks

---

### Critical Fix #3: Rotate Secrets (30 min)

**Problem:** Exposed keys must be invalidated

**Actions:**
```bash
# 1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
# https://app.supabase.com/project/YOUR_PROJECT/settings/api

# 2. Click "Reset service_role key"

# 3. Copy new key

# 4. Update in Vercel
vercel env add SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY production
# Paste new key

# 5. Update locally
echo "SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=new-key-here" >> server/.env.local
```

**Impact:** Invalidates exposed credentials

---

### Critical Fix #4: Deploy Emergency Patch (30 min)

**Actions:**
```bash
# 1. Verify all changes
git status
git log --oneline -n 5

# 2. Deploy to production
cd server
vercel --prod

# 3. Verify deployment
curl https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/licenses
# Should return 401 Unauthorized (no API key)

# 4. Test with API key
curl -H "X-API-Key: your-key" https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/licenses
# Should work
```

**Impact:** Deploys critical security fixes
